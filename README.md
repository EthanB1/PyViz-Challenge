# Visualizing-SF-housing-with-PyViz


### Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. I'm an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

### My job is to use my data visualisation skills, including aggregation, interactive visualisations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

## Steps:
1. Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year
2. Calculate and Plot the Average Sale Prices per Square Foot
3. Compare the Average Sale Prices by Neighbourhood
4. Build an Interactive Neighborhood Map
